<h1><b>Terms & Condition</b></h1>

Use HTML5 attributes like required, pattern, title, maxlength, etc., to enforce input validation.

No JavaScript validation is required.

The form's action attribute can point to # as the backend is not required.

Use an iframe with the srcdoc attribute to embed terms inside the page without an external file.

Make sure the page works in all modern browsers.
