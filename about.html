        <h2>History & Mission of the University</h2>
        <p>National Institute of Technology Warangal, formerly known as Regional Engineering College,
	 was established in 1959.
	 Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru laid the foundation stone for this institute on October 10, 1959, 
	 the first in the chain of 31 NITs (formerly known as RECs) in the country.

	The Institute is well known for its dedicated faculty,
	staff and the state-of-the art infrastructure conducive to a healthy academic environment.
	The Institute is constantly striving to achieve higher levels of technical excellence.
	Evolving a socially relevant and yet internationally acceptable curriculum,
	implementing innovative and effective teaching methodologies and focusing on the wholesome 
	development of the students are our concerns.
	Thanks to UNESCO and UK assistance in the past, many developmental activities were undertaken.
	The World Bank Assistance under Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme (TEQIP) had 
	been a timely help in the overall development of the Institute.
